# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing single-file Wazuh AI Companion chatbot (chatbot.py) into a production-ready, scalable security analysis platform following modern software architecture principles. The current 600-line monolithic application needs to be refactored into a multi-layered, containerized system that can handle enterprise-scale deployments while maintaining all existing functionality and adding new capabilities for user management, analytics, and system administration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to interact with the AI assistant through a modern, scalable web application, so that I can perform threat hunting efficiently without system performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL maintain all existing chat functionality from the original chatbot.py
2. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent WebSocket connections without performance degradation
3. WHEN the system processes user queries THEN response times SHALL remain under 2 seconds for 95% of requests
4. WHEN the system scales horizontally THEN it SHALL support at least 100 concurrent users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper user authentication and role-based access control, so that I can manage who has access to sensitive security data and system functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access the system THEN they SHALL be required to authenticate with valid credentials
2. WHEN authentication is implemented THEN it SHALL use JWT tokens instead of basic HTTP authentication
3. WHEN user roles are defined THEN the system SHALL support Admin, Analyst, and Viewer roles with appropriate permissions
4. WHEN an admin manages users THEN they SHALL be able to create, update, and deactivate user accounts
5. WHEN session management is implemented THEN it SHALL use Redis for session storage and management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to follow microservices architecture principles, so that I can deploy, scale, and maintain individual components independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the monolithic chatbot.py SHALL be split into separate service modules
2. WHEN services are implemented THEN they SHALL include auth_service, log_service, ai_service, chat_service, and analytics_service
3. WHEN the API layer is created THEN it SHALL follow RESTful principles with versioned endpoints (/api/v1/)
4. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use well-defined interfaces and dependency injection
5. WHEN the application starts THEN each service SHALL be independently testable and deployable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security operations team, I want persistent data storage for user sessions, chat history, and analytics, so that we can track usage patterns and maintain conversation context across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data models are implemented THEN they SHALL include User, Chat, Log, and Analytics entities
2. WHEN the database layer is created THEN it SHALL use PostgreSQL for structured data storage
3. WHEN chat sessions are managed THEN conversation history SHALL persist across user sessions
4. WHEN analytics are collected THEN the system SHALL track user engagement, query patterns, and system performance metrics
5. WHEN vector embeddings are stored THEN they SHALL use FAISS or similar vector database for AI operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the application to be containerized and orchestrated, so that it can be deployed consistently across different environments with proper scaling and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containerization is implemented THEN each service SHALL have its own Docker container
2. WHEN Docker Compose is configured THEN it SHALL support local development with all required services
3. WHEN Kubernetes manifests are created THEN they SHALL support production deployment with auto-scaling
4. WHEN monitoring is implemented THEN it SHALL include Prometheus metrics collection and Grafana dashboards
5. WHEN logging is configured THEN it SHALL use structured JSON logging with centralized log aggregation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive security measures implemented, so that the system protects sensitive log data and prevents unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTPS/TLS is implemented THEN all communications SHALL be encrypted in transit
2. WHEN input validation is added THEN it SHALL prevent injection attacks and malformed requests
3. WHEN rate limiting is implemented THEN it SHALL prevent abuse and DoS attacks
4. WHEN audit logging is configured THEN it SHALL track all user actions and system events for compliance
5. WHEN secrets management is implemented THEN sensitive configuration SHALL be stored securely

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a development team, I want comprehensive testing and CI/CD pipelines, so that we can maintain code quality and deploy changes safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are implemented THEN they SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage
2. WHEN integration tests are created THEN they SHALL verify service interactions and API endpoints
3. WHEN end-to-end tests are implemented THEN they SHALL validate complete user workflows
4. WHEN CI/CD pipeline is configured THEN it SHALL run automated tests and deploy to staging/production
5. WHEN code quality tools are integrated THEN they SHALL enforce coding standards and security scanning

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an operations team, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability, so that I can proactively identify and resolve system issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application metrics are collected THEN they SHALL include request latency, throughput, and error rates
2. WHEN AI model performance is monitored THEN it SHALL track response times and accuracy metrics
3. WHEN system health is monitored THEN it SHALL include database performance and WebSocket connection health
4. WHEN alerting is configured THEN it SHALL notify operators of critical system issues
5. WHEN dashboards are created THEN they SHALL provide real-time visibility into system performance and business metrics
