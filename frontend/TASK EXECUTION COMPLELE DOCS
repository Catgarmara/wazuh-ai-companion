● Task Execution Complete ✅

  I have successfully completed the comprehensive Docker configuration for      
  the frontend application. Here's what was implemented:

  Completed Docker Frontend Implementation:

  1. Multi-stage Dockerfile (frontend/Dockerfile)
    - Development and production build stages
    - Node.js 18 Alpine base image for efficiency
    - Optimized layer caching with dependencies
    - Security-focused non-root user configuration
    - Health checks for both development and production
    - Standalone Next.js output for production optimization
  2. Docker Ignore Configuration (frontend/.dockerignore)
    - Comprehensive file exclusions for optimal build context
    - Excludes node_modules, build outputs, and development files
    - Reduces build time and image size significantly
  3. Environment Configuration (frontend/.env.docker)
    - Complete environment variable setup for Docker
    - Feature flags and configuration options
    - API and WebSocket URL configuration
    - Performance and security settings
  4. Health Check API Route (frontend/src/app/api/health/route.ts)
    - Next.js API route for container health monitoring
    - Returns comprehensive service status information
    - Includes feature flags and configuration details
    - Proper error handling and status codes
  5. Updated Docker Compose Configuration
    - Added frontend service to docker-compose.yml (development)
    - Added frontend service to docker-compose.prod.yml (production)
    - Proper service dependencies and networking
    - Volume mounts for hot reload in development
    - Resource limits and replicas for production
  6. Enhanced Nginx Configuration (nginx/nginx.conf)
    - Dual upstream configuration for frontend and backend
    - Rate limiting for API and general requests
    - Static asset caching with long expiration
    - WebSocket support for backend services
    - Client-side routing support for React/Next.js
    - Enhanced security headers and CSP policies
  7. Management Script (scripts/docker-setup.sh)
    - Comprehensive Docker environment management
    - Development and production environment support
    - Service health checking and monitoring
    - Database initialization and migration commands
    - Build, rebuild, and cleanup operations
    - Logging and troubleshooting utilities
  8. Documentation (DOCKER_SETUP_README.md)
    - Complete setup and usage guide
    - Architecture overview and service descriptions
    - Configuration instructions and best practices
    - Troubleshooting guide with common issues
    - Security considerations for production
    - Performance optimization recommendations

  Key Features Implemented:

  - Multi-Environment Support: Separate configurations for development and      
  production
  - Service Integration: Proper networking and service discovery between        
  containers
  - Health Monitoring: Comprehensive health checks for all services
  - Security Hardening: Non-root users, security headers, and rate limiting     
  - Performance Optimization: Multi-stage builds, caching, and resource
  limits
  - Hot Reload Support: Development environment with live code updates
  - Production Ready: Optimized production builds with proper resource
  allocation
  - Monitoring Integration: Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
  - Easy Management: Comprehensive script for Docker operations

  Docker Services Architecture:

  - Frontend: Next.js 14 application (port 3000)
  - Backend: FastAPI application (port 8000)
  - Database: PostgreSQL 15 (port 5432)
  - Cache: Redis 7 (port 6379)
  - LLM: Ollama service (port 11434)
  - Proxy: Nginx reverse proxy (ports 80/443)
  - Monitoring: Prometheus (9090) + Grafana (3001 in prod)

  The Docker configuration now provides a complete containerized
  environment that supports both development and production deployments
  with proper service orchestration, monitoring, and management
  capabilities.
