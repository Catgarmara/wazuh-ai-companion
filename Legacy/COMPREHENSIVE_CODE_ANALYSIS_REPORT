‚óè üìä Comprehensive Code Analysis Report

  üéØ Project Overview

  Wazuh AI Companion is a sophisticated SOC automation platform designed to     
   address critical security operations challenges through AI-enhanced
  threat hunting and log analysis. The system processes real security
  events in enterprise environments, providing automated triage and threat      
  detection capabilities.

  Core Mission

  - Problem: SOC analyst burnout (70% time on repetitive tasks) and alert       
  fatigue (10K+ daily alerts)
  - Solution: Local AI deployment for regulatory compliance with sub-200ms      
  threat detection
  - Impact: Supporting ¬£150K+ MSSP migration while maintaining 24/7
  capabilities
