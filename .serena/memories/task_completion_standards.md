# Task Completion Standards

## Code Quality Requirements

### Before Marking Any Task Complete

1. **Type Safety**: All Python code must use proper type hints and pass validation
2. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
3. **Security Validation**: Ensure all inputs are validated and outputs are sanitized
4. **Testing**: Write appropriate tests based on the component type
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation and comments

### Testing Requirements by Component Type

**API Endpoints**:
- Unit tests for request/response validation
- Integration tests with database interaction
- Security tests for authentication and authorization
- Error handling tests for edge cases

**Service Layer**:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Mock tests for external dependencies
- Error propagation tests
- Performance tests for critical paths

**Database Models**:
- Migration tests for schema changes
- Constraint validation tests
- Relationship integrity tests
- Data consistency tests

**AI Components**:
- Model loading and inference tests
- Resource management tests
- Error handling for model failures
- Memory usage validation

### Security Standards

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- JWT token validation
- Role-based access control verification
- Session management security
- Permission boundary testing

**Input Validation**:
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Command injection prevention
- File upload security (if applicable)

**Data Protection**:
- Sensitive data encryption
- Secure data transmission
- Audit trail completeness
- Data retention compliance

## Commands to Run Before Task Completion

### Essential Validation Commands
```bash
# 1. Run all tests to ensure nothing is broken
make test
# or: pytest tests/ -v

# 2. Check specific test categories
pytest tests/ -m unit          # Unit tests
pytest tests/ -m integration   # Integration tests
pytest tests/ -m security      # Security tests

# 3. Verify application starts correctly
make up
make health

# 4. Check database migrations are applied
make db-migrate

# 5. Verify all services are healthy
docker-compose ps
```

### Frontend-Specific Commands (when applicable)
```bash
# Type checking
docker-compose exec frontend npm run type-check

# Linting
docker-compose exec frontend npm run lint

# Build verification
docker-compose exec frontend npm run build

# Frontend tests
docker-compose exec frontend npm run test
```

### Performance Validation
```bash
# Resource usage check
docker stats

# API performance validation
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -s "http://localhost:8000/health"

# Database connection verification
docker-compose exec app python -c "from core.database import get_db; print('DB OK')"
```

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- Docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Inline comments for complex business logic
- API endpoint documentation with examples
- Database schema documentation

### System Documentation
- Update README if architecture changes
- Update deployment guides for new configuration
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Update monitoring dashboards for new metrics

## AI/ML Specific Standards

### Model Integration
- Model loading validation
- Resource usage monitoring
- Inference accuracy verification
- Fallback mechanism testing

### SIEM Integration
- Query translation validation
- External API connection testing
- Error handling for SIEM failures
- Data parsing verification

## Deployment Readiness Checklist

### Configuration Validation
- [ ] Environment variables properly set
- [ ] Secret management configured
- [ ] Database connections verified
- [ ] External service integrations tested

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms working
- [ ] Authorization rules enforced
- [ ] Audit logging functional
- [ ] Input validation comprehensive

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] API response times acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] AI model inference responsive

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Health checks responding
- [ ] Metrics being collected
- [ ] Logs properly structured
- [ ] Alerts configured

## Definition of Done

A task is considered complete when:

1. **Functionality**: All acceptance criteria met and tested
2. **Quality**: Code passes all quality gates and follows established patterns
3. **Security**: Security requirements validated and tested
4. **Testing**: Appropriate test coverage with passing tests
5. **Documentation**: Code and system documentation updated
6. **Integration**: Successfully integrates with existing system components
7. **Performance**: Meets performance requirements and resource constraints
8. **Deployment**: Ready for deployment to target environment

### Critical Security Appliance Requirements

For this security-focused application, additional completion criteria:

- **No External Dependencies**: AI processing remains completely local
- **Data Privacy**: No sensitive data leaves the appliance
- **Audit Compliance**: All actions properly logged and auditable
- **Resource Management**: Efficient use of system resources
- **SIEM Compatibility**: Proper integration with existing security infrastructure
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failures without data loss

These standards ensure that every completed task maintains the security, reliability, and performance requirements of a production security appliance.
