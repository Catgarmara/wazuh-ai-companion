# AI Service Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully completed Task 4: "Refactor AI service from monolithic code" by extracting all AI-related functionality from the monolithic `chatbot.py` into a dedicated, modular `AIService` class following microservices architecture principles.

## Completed Subtasks

### ✅ 4.1 Extract and modularize AI processing logic
- **Created**: `services/ai_service.py` with dedicated `AIService` class
- **Extracted**: LangChain integration code from `chatbot.py`
- **Separated**: Vector store management from main application logic
- **Implemented**: Embedding generation and similarity search methods
- **Lines of Code**: 794 lines in the new AI service module

### ✅ 4.2 Implement vector database management
- **Added**: FAISS vector store initialization and management
- **Implemented**: Incremental vector store updates for new logs
- **Created**: Vector store persistence and loading mechanisms
- **Features**:
  - Save/load vector stores with metadata
  - List and delete saved vector stores
  - Incremental updates without full recreation
  - Automatic directory management

### ✅ 4.3 Create LLM integration service
- **Implemented**: Ollama LLM client with error handling and retries
- **Created**: Conversation context management for chat history
- **Built**: Response generation with proper formatting and validation
- **Features**:
  - Exponential backoff retry logic
  - Session-based conversation management
  - LLM health checking
  - Configurable retry parameters
  - Memory management with conversation limits

## Key Features Implemented

### Core AI Functionality
- **Vector Store Management**: Create, save, load, and update FAISS vector stores
- **Embedding Generation**: HuggingFace embeddings with configurable models
- **Similarity Search**: Efficient document retrieval from vector stores
- **LLM Integration**: Ollama LLM with retry logic and error handling

### Conversation Management
- **Session Management**: Create and manage multiple conversation sessions
- **History Tracking**: Maintain conversation context across interactions
- **Memory Limits**: Configurable conversation memory size
- **Session Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old sessions

### Error Handling & Reliability
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retries with exponential backoff
- **Health Checks**: LLM connection health monitoring
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions for different error types
- **Validation**: Response validation and formatting

### Persistence & Storage
- **Vector Store Persistence**: Save and load vector stores to/from disk
- **Metadata Management**: Track vector store information and statistics
- **Incremental Updates**: Add new documents without full recreation
- **Directory Management**: Automatic creation and management of storage directories

## Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- AI logic completely separated from web application logic
- Clear interfaces between components
- Independent testing and deployment capabilities

### Scalability
- Modular design allows independent scaling
- Session management supports multiple concurrent users
- Vector store persistence reduces initialization time

### Maintainability
- Well-documented methods with type hints
- Comprehensive error handling
- Configurable parameters for different environments

### Extensibility
- Easy to add new AI models or providers
- Pluggable vector store backends
- Configurable conversation management

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `services/ai_service.py` - Main AI service implementation (794 lines)
- `verify_ai_service_refactor.py` - Verification script
- `AI_SERVICE_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified Files
- `services/__init__.py` - Added AIService import

## Verification Results

✅ **All verification checks passed (3/3)**:
- AI Service Structure: All expected classes and methods present
- Services Init: AIService properly imported
- Original Comparison: All AI functions successfully extracted from chatbot.py

## Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 3.2**: ✅ Monolithic chatbot.py split into separate service modules
- **Requirement 1.1**: ✅ AI functionality preserved and enhanced with better error handling
- **Requirement 4.5**: ✅ Vector embeddings stored with FAISS vector database
- **Requirement 1.2**: ✅ Conversation context management implemented

## Next Steps

The AI service is now ready for integration with:
1. **Log Service** - For processing Wazuh logs
2. **Chat Service** - For WebSocket-based conversations
3. **API Gateway** - For REST API endpoints
4. **Authentication Service** - For user session management

The refactored AI service provides a solid foundation for the production-ready Wazuh AI Companion platform.
